A Flex divided list component, it has similar logic as the address book app on iOS. Parts of the code and original idea is taken from the Adobe MAX 2011 app.

Its intended as a mobile component, to compile for the desktop you need to do the following:  
1. Include [Flex SDK number]/frameworks/libs/mobile/mobilecomponents.swc as a library
2. Use mobile.swc as a theme for the app found in the Flex SKD's theme folder.
